# üß† Brain Tumor Segmentation & Survival Prediction

This repository provides a dual-model pipeline for **brain tumor segmentation** and **survival prediction**, combining the robustness of a custom **3D ResUNet** (in research development) with the performance of **Swin UNETR** (in deployment). It includes a Jupyter notebook for experimentation and a Streamlit web app for live inference.

## üìä Notebook: `brain-tumor-seg-final.ipynb`

- Uses **custom 3D ResUNet** architecture
- Trains on BraTS 2020 dataset
- Applies multi-channel input for rich spatial features
- Custom loss function: Dice + Cross Entropy
- Performs segmentation + extracts tumor features
- Builds survival prediction model based on segmentation-derived data

---

## üåê Web App: `app.py`

- Built with **Streamlit** for user-friendly interaction
- Utilizes **Swin UNETR** (from MONAI) for segmentation
- Requires upload of 4 aligned `.nii` or `.nii.gz` files:
  - T1, T1CE, T2, FLAIR
- Displays central axial slice with segmentation overlay
- Automatically uploads the output slice to **Imgur** and returns a shareable link
- Login access for secure usage
